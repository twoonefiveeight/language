Programming Language Objectives

1. Easily accessible to a complete novice
2. Easier constructs. Ease of coding is paramount 
3. Object Oriented. But no unexpected behaviour like in Python
4. Readability

Personal Goal - Satisfaction and learning!

Bottomline - Prerana should be able to code using it!

Technical Stuff

Interpreted vs Compiled ? - TBD
Types - Implicit vs Explicit ? Implicit for now
Only one float type and one integer type - Compiler/Runtime Environment should efficiently manage what the type of this variable actually is! - Ambitious, but interesting
