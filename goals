Programming Language STARK Objectives

1. Easily accessible to a complete novice
2. Easier constructs. Ease of coding is paramount 
3. Object Oriented. But no unexpected behaviour like in Python
4. Readability

Personal Goal - Satisfaction and learning!

Bottomline - Prerana should be able to code using it!

Technical Stuff

Interpreted vs Compiled ? - TBD

Types - Implicit vs Explicit ? Implicit for now

Only one float type and one integer type - Compiler/Runtime Environment should efficiently manage what the type of this variable actually is! - Ambitious, but interesting

No import statements. Compiler should automatically identify which libraries are being used by the code in the program (resolve conflicts, with 
user intervention if necessary i.e. function with same name defined in multiple libraries and used in the same program. ) and include them.

Function calls - Call by value vs call by reference ?

Implicit string to number and number to string conversion wherever appropriate. Might need some mechanism to differentiate between whether a
string that consists only of numbers is being used as a string or as a number!
